  A common pattern for loop usage is iteration over the elements of a set.
  This theory provides the @{text "FOREACH"}-combinator, that iterates over 
  each element of a set.

  invariants.

subsection {* Definition *}

text {*
  Foreach-loops come in different versions, depending on whether they have an 
  annotated invariant (I), a termination condition (C), and an order (O).

  Note that asserting that the set is finite is not necessary to guarantee
  termination. However, we currently provide only iteration over finite sets,
  as this also matches the ICF concept of iterators.
